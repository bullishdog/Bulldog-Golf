# Bulldog-Golf
The goal is to create a golf simulator that can pull golf shot data in from multiple simulators
  Trackman, Flightscope, Foresight GC2&Quad, SkyTrak, and others

Driving Range Mode
  Open driving range, just shot data on open field
  One target green, 10 yard radius
  Moveable target distances
  No golf hazards

Compete Mode
  Compete against others online in several game modes
    Longest Drive
    Most consecutive shots on green
    Total Hole-Outs
    etc.
  Solo Shot Shaping
    Randomly generate shot shaping tasks
    Take ball flight data and report on whether task was completed
    etc.
    
Playing
  Last goal of simulation
  Aiming the project more at golf instruction and range competition versus playing simulated golf
